As the year comes to a close, I have been reflecting on what a good year it has been.  This is the year I learned to snowboard, tried Nordic/cross country (classic) skiing, and went to several great CEU courses over concussion rehab, hamstring specific rehab, and running summit where I learned a ton.

I also visited Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks for the first time.

 And was able to visit my friends for weddings, baby shower, and girl's trip.

I spent time with my entire family for vacation, completed my first half marathon, and in the between moments enjoyed my job and ate lots of good food.  I am thankful for this past year God has given me and am excited for the next one! Thanks for coming along my journey :)
