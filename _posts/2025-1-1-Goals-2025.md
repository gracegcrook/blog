And just like that, the new year is upon us.  Some people think it's clique to have New Year Resolutions, I find they keep me motivated and on track.  Where New Year Resolutions seem to fall off is being either unattainable or too many.  If shooting for nothing, you will hit it every time.  I have my goals broken into categories below.  Some I have modified slightly due to privacy reasons and there are several not listed due to being personal.

**Fitness**
•	Prioritize strength over muscle hypertrophy (low reps, high resistance)
•	Focus plyometrics and power/speed 
•	Build a solid running base 
•	Complete 2nd half marathon :)  (may decided a goal race time if I stay injury free)

**Financial**
•	Pay off highest interest loan
•	Meet 3K emergency fund goal
•	Max out Roth IRA
•	Pay down debt to or past target amount set

**CEUs/PT goals**
•	Functional Dry Needling certification 
•	Barbell Rehab in-person course (hopefully)
•	Establish work Lunch & Learn monthly

**Family & Friends**
•	Travel to see all members of my immediate family at least 1x this year
•	Intentionally keep up with close friends at least 1x/month even if just a text

**Blog**
•	Average 2 posts/month
•	Make content I would like to make/read

I will be checking in with progress reports on these goals throughout the year.  Excited to see what I can accomplish.  Happy New Year!
