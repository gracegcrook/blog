Quick update on my 2025 goals.  I feel like this first quarter went by fast.  I did a lot of traveling to snowboard, see friends, and away at conferences.  It has been challenging to stay on top of everything that I want to, but so far have been managing fairly well.  Here are my current standings in all the categories posted in January with updates on them in italics:

**Fitness**
* Prioritize strength over muscle hypertrophy (low reps, high resistance) *doing well for the most part, but have been in the gym a little less due to snowboarding more*
* Focus on plyometrics and power/speed *keeping strength a priority, but will transition to this in the next month or so*
* Build a solid running base *started :)* 
* Complete 2nd half marathon :)  (may decided a goal race time if I stay injury free) *Will do in Oct*

**Financial**
*Doing very well overall for financial goals.  Meeting monthly contributions to hit target end of the target end-of-the-year goals.  Have been a little tight financially to do this, so might reassess how realistic these all are.*
* Pay off highest interest loan 
* Meet 3K emergency fund goal 
* Max out Roth IRA 
* Pay down debt to or past target amount set

**CEUs/PT goals**
* Functional Dry Needling certification *MET! Certified Dry Needling lvl-1*
* Barbell Rehab in-person course (hopefully) *Nothing currently set, haven't seen any coming in my nearby area*
* Establish work Lunch & Learn monthly *MET! Have to continue to plan for each month*

**Family & Friends**
* Travel to see all members of my immediate family at least 1x this year *progressing/have a trip planned to see a few*
* Intentionally keep up with close friends at least 1x/month even if just a text *Doing fair with this.  Haven't gotten to all of my close friends, but overall have been more intentional with connecting and this was the main part of the goal I wanted to achieve*

**Blog**
* Average 2 posts/month *Not doing the best at this, have at least 1x/month, but I would like to be more consistent.*
* Make content I would like to make/read *I feel I have done a good job at this goal for the blog.  My posts have been less frequent, but more concise and thoughtful, I think.*
