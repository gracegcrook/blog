title: Life Lately (better headspace than last post)
---
Well, I have since been on the up and up since my last post.  I needed some time to process my feelings as well as have some time to get outside and not be stuck in my thoughts.

As it would have it, I have discovered a new skill I am in the process of learning in the form of rock climbing at the rock climbing gym.  I was initially invited by a former patient and her husband to try it out at our local rock climbing gym.  It must be the PT in me, but apparently I must enjoy not being good at sports and figuring out the movement patterns needed to be successful at them.  I think I enjoy the challenging of improving on my skills (or lack thereof).  There are so many skilled individuals who live in my town that are really quite impressive to watch.  It take time and talent to do what some of these people do.  Watching people in their element (doing what they were born to do) is inspiring.

I also made it out to the Tetons and got to bike at Teton Park Road prior to the reopening for the spring (they shut this portion off in the winter).  It was a gorgeous day and I have found that the Tetons with a little snow on them is my favorite look.  It creates so much depth with making the texture of the mountains pop.  Though I stated in the paragraph above that I have enjoyed learning new skills, biking is one I have yet to pursue more that recreationally.  My butt hurts 10 minutes into a ride and even with "training it" I still have a hard time sitting past 30 minutes.  I probably need to invest in bike shorts with the pads and maybe even see if my seat needs adjusting.

Speaking of the Tetons, me and two of my close PT friends were able to make it out to camp in the Tetons.  I really needed this time together and it was so fun to hang out even if it was just for the weekend.  We did a couple small hikes as the snow in the upper saddle was still very prominent and just sat around the campfire and ate food.  We also woke up early to take a couple photos of the Tetons, which turned out really nice.  Lastly, we recorded a podcast for my [friends' podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp0nJmDOp7wchannel) by the fire. If you look close enough you can see the Tetons peeking out in the left corner on the Youtube video of the podcast!

It was a much needed camp weekend.  Only thing that could have been better is if I didn't burn 2 quarter sized holes in my Patagonia puffer. (Update: Patagonia repaired this as it was covered under warranty :)
