Well, guess it's that time of the year.  I was hesitant in making a gift guide to post here on the blog because I don't want to promote consumerism and would hate to shadow the true meaning of Christmas and this holiday season (our savior Jesus being born).  I finally settled on making one as gifts are one of my love languages and have always been a favorite post to read.  Because I am into fitness, many of these lean that way, but I do have some ideas that will work for those in fitness and those not.

**Running**
 First on the list are running socks.  I feel socks are one of those items you can always get more as they wear down quicky.  I wear the Puma socks from Costco (so affordable!) and Bombas for running but would love to try the **[Injinji toe socks](https://www.injinji.com/) 

Safety and visibility for runners is especially important when days are shorter and the likelihood of running in the dark is higher.  Visibility products such as a headlamp, running vest, or reflective running gear make running in the dark just a little safer.  There are many **[reflective vests](https://www.amazon.com/reflective-running-vest/s?k=reflective+running+vest)** you can buy and they aren't too pricey either.  If you want a little more visibility I just got the Tracer2 vest by **[NoxGear](https://www.noxgear.com/tracer2)** and am enjoying extra visibility with the light up vest (be sure to shop when on sale as you can get them for half off.  Review to come out after I get more runs in it).

One more gear I wanted to add here was a running belt.  Running vests are all the rage I feel, but I like belts a little better.  I have been running and racing in the **[Flipbelt](https://flipbelt.com/collections/running-belts)**.  It stays put and holds a lot for the size.  I would like to give the **[Raide Research LF 2L belt](https://raideresearch.com/products/lf-2l)** a try next season.  It is spendy but I tried it on in person and seems like it is well made and well thought out.  The reviews also look promising. 

Last but not least for this category is fuel!  Fuel is one of those things runners can never have too much of.  While candy does work and is more economical for the wallet, actual running fuel makes you feel "fancy" and usually is easier to handle come race day (at least in my opinion).  Fuel can include but not limited to gels, gummies, electrolytes, waffles, quick carbs...  My current favorite gels are the **[BPN Go Gels](https://www.bareperformancenutrition.com/products/go-gel)**, specifically the mango flavor.  For gummies I like the **[Clif Blocs](https://shop.clifbar.com/collections/bloks-energy-chews#bloks-energy-chews)** in salted watermelon flavor.

**Health**
•	Starting off the health category is a fitness app like **[BiaFit](https://apps.apple.com/kw/app/bia-fit/id6475781001)** or **[Runna](https://www.runna.com/)**.  These are a great addition for those wanting to be consistent with their training but don't really know where to start or don't have time to make themselves a plan.  Not all fitness apps are created equal so doing quick research and reading reviews is good practice to get a decent plan.  If not a plan, a gym membership or a session with a personal trainer might be a great gift as well!
•	Gift cards are another easy and quick last minute gift.  Ones like Whole Foods or Trader Joe's are appreciated as fueling a body can get pricey!  It takes a lot to fuel a healthy body.
•	For your competition loving (or someone who just needs a goal to shoot for) a race or competition is also an exciting experiential gift.

**Other**
Quick fire for this category: Under eye patches (**[Hero Cosmetics](https://www.herocosmetics.us/collections/under-eye-care)** is my favorite), face masks (**[Avatara](https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=avatara+face+mask&category=0%7CAll%7Cmatchallpartial%7Call+categories&tref=typeahead%7Cterm%7C0%7Cavatara+face+mask%7Cavatara+face+mask%7C%7C%7Cservice%7C%7C%7C%7C%7Ccategory_v3&searchTermRaw=avatara)** and **[Dr Jart](https://www.drjart.com/)**), eye masks (these ones from **[CorneaCare](https://mycorneacare.com/shop/eyelid-hygiene/self-heating-warm-compress/)** look so cozy), picture print outs, art print outs, tea (currently into **[Pukka](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/uk/en/)** and **[Teeccino](https://teeccino.com/)**), candles (like the Christmas set from **[Bavovna candles](https://bavovnacandles.com/collections/christmas-candles)**, **[Wellness by Ari](https://wellnessbyari.com/)**), and cute soap shaped sheep from **[Thomson Home](https://www.thomsonhome.com/products/meadow-mini-sheep-soap)**

If none of these seemed to fit your giftee, a great gift to give is a heartfelt and hand written letter.  While it may seem like a cop out, sometimes a letter takes more intentionality and thoughtfulness.
Gifts should be intentional and should not put you in a position where you are going financially broke.  The biggest thing to remember is we don't *HAVE* to gift everyone something just because.  Hope this gift guide was helpful or at least fun to read!
