Hello :)

I’m Grace. Welcome to my blog! I am a physical therapist (DPT) and a certified strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) who likes to exercise, bake, eat good food, go on drives, and hang with my family and friends.

Since I was in my early teens, I have enjoyed reading blogs. Some of the first ones I remember reading were...
* [Sweet Miles](https://www.instagram.com/ingles_outside/) (no longer running but occasionally posts @ingles_outside on Instagram now)
* [Hungry Runner Girl](https://hungryrunnergirl.com/)
* [Fitnessista](https://fitnessista.com/)

When I started physical therapy school I thought it would be the perfect time to document my life and finally start blogging. I knew I was not ready for a blog page, instead, I decided to work through an Instagram account where I could do “short form” blogging. It was a good idea at the start but quickly became hard to balance going to school full time while also working a part time job.

Now that I’ve graduated and started working, I finally have a little bit more of a consistent schedule. My plan is to blog primary around fitness, health, and things I’m learning as a PT. Hope you enjoy tagging along!
